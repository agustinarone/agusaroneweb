## 🎯 1. Objective

The goal of this site is to communicate who Agus is as a **strategic product manager** — someone who connects strategy, design, and data to build clarity in complex products.

It’s not about showing volume of work; it’s about communicating **clarity, reasoning, and perspective.**
